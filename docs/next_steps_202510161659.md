how to try
Ensure $VISUAL or $EDITOR is set to your preferred editor in your shell.
Build/type-check: I ran a workspace type-check and it passed with no errors.
Run the bin (virt_manager): it should now link and launch the Iced app.
Open Add Hardware → Graphics → click “Edit XML…”, make changes, save and exit the editor.
On editor exit, the app will parse the XML and immediately reflect updates in the Graphics UI.
A status line will confirm success or report errors (e.g., parse failures).
quality gates
Build/Typecheck: PASS (cargo check returned no errors).
Lint: PASS (removed unused import; no warnings reported).
Tests: None present for this part of the codebase; manual smoke-testing via UI is advised.
Requirements coverage:

“Parse the state after editing, don’t require an additional step to apply changes” → Done.
“Fix bin crate unresolved lib dependency” → Done (rlib included).
notes and next steps
The temporary XML file currently persists after editing; we can clean it up post-apply in a follow-up.
Next feature: start the Controller page (UI + serde model), then move to real backend wiring once we pick a maintained libvirt Rust binding.
If you want, I can also add a small “View XML” preview or validation badge before launching the editor.
